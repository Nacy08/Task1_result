"Usually , when people suppress a lot they bottle up emotions as a coping mechanism which may come from trauma etc . Which means when they are presented with an emotional situation they cannot exactly explain what they feel/ shutdown or door slam . It is completely okay to feel overwhelmed in stressful situations . However , you will need to self- reflect and figure out how and what caused you to feel that way . In that manner you will feel better and be more conscious . Sometimes , I’d say most people would cry which is easier to express stress , sadness and loneliness . Since it’s more wiser than speaking words to people who wouldn’t understand .
